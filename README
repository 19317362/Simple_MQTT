This folder contains client certificates for you to test.

An example usage of python client:		

	mqttc.tls_set(CA_CERTS, CERTFILE, KEYFILE)
	mqttc.connect(YOUR_BROKER_IP, PORT)

you need to specify the location of your CA_CERTS, CERTFILE, KEYFILE, and the default PORT is 8883 for secure connection.
